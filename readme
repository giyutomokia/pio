# Rule Engine Application

## Overview

The Rule Engine Application determines user eligibility based on attributes like age, department, income, and spending using an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to create and evaluate rules.

## 10 Steps to Set Up and Use the Application

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd rule-engine
2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
3. Install Required Packages
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Set Up the Database
Ensure SQLite is installed and configured. The application will automatically create a database file when it runs.
5. Run the Application
bash
Copy code
python app.py
6. Access the Application
Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
7. Create a Rule
Enter a rule (e.g., age > 30 AND department = 'Sales') in the form and click "Create Rule."
8. Evaluate a Rule
To test rules against user attributes, use the /evaluate_rule API endpoint with a JSON request body:
json
Copy code
{
    "attributes": {
        "age": 35,
        "department": "Sales"
    }
}
9. View Output
The evaluation will return a JSON response indicating whether the attributes meet the rule conditions:
json
Copy code
{
    "result": true
}
10. Handle Errors
The application includes error handling for invalid rules. If there's an error, you will receive a message like:
json
Copy code
{
    "error": "Invalid rule syntax"
}
